## Additional info
I prefer to write unit and integration tests for almost everything, sometimes before writing the code. It's very helpful
for refactoring and makes me more confident in my work. Also I prefer to use functional programming patterns even in
OO languages: if something can be done with pure functions - I will do it in this way, but without fanaticism
and breaking the rest architecture.

Ruby is a very magical language and allows deveper to make one task in different ways,
so I usually write my code in a very obvious manner, but when the task requires to write boilerplate code, I use metaprogramming.
If something can be done without metaprogramming and other magic it should be done without metaprogramming and magic. I prefer
explicit interfaces in my code, it simplifies reading and understanding.

I like Ruby because it helps me to write very expressive code very fast. Ruby is a good choice for writing tricky business
logic if it should't be very fast. Code can be tested in a very easy way and programmer can focus on business requirements
instead of platform limitations.

I like Go because it is the most nonmagical language I've ever known, it allows to white very transparent and understandable
concurrent code with high perfomance and without additional runtime. It's a good choice for very fast and small concurrent
programs for networks and tasks that requre low latency.

I don't like Python and JS because of API inconsistency, I can't enter into the flow state when I work with them.
