* Crosscompilation
* DDD
* TDD

## Additional info
I prefer to write unit and integration tests for almost everything, sometimes before writing the code. It's very helpful
for refactoring and makes me more confident in my work. Also I prefer to use functional programming patterns even in
OO languages: if something can be done with pure functions - I will do it in this way, but whithout fanaticism
and breaking the rest architecture. Ruby is a very magical language and allows deveper to make one task in different ways,
so I usually write my code in very obvious manner, but when the task requires to write boilerplate code, I use metaprogramming.
