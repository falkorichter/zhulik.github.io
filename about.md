# Boring part about programming and career

I am an ordinary programmer like you see every day: beard, backpack with laptop and so on. I stated my career in 2010 as
embedded Linux programmer in Ufa city, UZPS factory. I still love Linux and use Lenovo laptop as my working machine.
Anyway, on my fist job I got experience with C++, Qt, QML and some kinds of tricky libs and tools. I got understending
of cross-compilation and building different stuff for rare Linux distributions and achitectures. It was very helpful
when I worked in [RoadAR](http://www.roadar.ru/): I had some tasks about build RoadAR's CV software for different
(sometimes outdated) Linux distributions and (oh...)Windows.

I moved to Kazan in 2013. UZPS's management killed our media platform, so almost all programmers left the company in 3-4 months.
I started my career from the very beginning: I learned Ruby On Rails and became a full stack Rails developer. From mid-2013
to mid-2015 I worked in Raccoons Group - a web outsource company. I got experience in Ruby: backend architecture, Rails
patterns and antipatterns, non-related with Rails ruby programming. We did some tricky integrations between Ruby software
and MS ActiveDirectory and 1C(russian accounting software). Virtually, tasks wasn't very interesting and the salary wasn't
very big, so I left the company.

I worked in RoadAR from mid-2015 to mid-2016 and it was very iteresting. They hired me for the role of Rails programmer.
The theirs previous programmer received a green card and moved to USA. For the first time I developed backend and
administration interface for [RoadAR APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.roadar.android). Some time later
company started project for car licence plate recognition and my C++ and building skills became usefull again. I was some
kind of release-engeneer for this project: all my —Åolleagues were zealous Mac users with no experience in Linux. I moved
building system from Xcode to CMake and persuaded everybody to use it. Then I made this [tool](https://github.com/zhulik/bubing)
which helped me to build self-sufficient bundles of linux software and run it on any distribution. Actually I didn't want
to work with low-level stack like C++/OpenCV and so on, so I thoutght about chaning job again.
