# Boring part about programming and career

I am an ordinary programmer like the ones you see every day: beard, backpack with a laptop and so on. I stated my career in 2011 as
embedded Linux programmer at UZPS factory, Ufa city. I still love Linux and use Lenovo laptop as my working machine.
Anyway, at my fist job I got experience with C++, Qt, QML and some kinds of tricky libs and tools. I got understending
of cross-compilation and building different stuff for rare Linux distributions and achitectures. It was very helpful
when I worked in [RoadAR](http://www.roadar.ru/): I had some tasks about build RoadAR's CV software for different
(sometimes outdated) Linux distributions and (oh...)Windows.

I moved to Kazan in 2013. UZPS's management killed our media platform, so almost all programmers left the company in 3-4 months.
I started my career from the very beginning: I learned Ruby On Rails and became a full stack Rails developer. From mid-2013
to mid-2015 I worked in Raccoons Group - an ordinary outsource company. I got experience with Ruby: backend architecture, Rails
patterns and antipatterns, non-related to Rails ruby programming. We made some tricky integrations between Ruby software
and MS ActiveDirectory and 1C(russian accounting software). Virtually, tasks wasn't very interesting and the salary wasn't
very big, so I left the company.

I worked in RoadAR from mid-2015 to mid-2016 and it was very iteresting. They hired me for the role of Rails programmer.
Theirs previous programmer received a green card and moved to USA. For the first time I developed backend and
administration interface for [RoadAR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.roadar.android). There were
many intersting tasks related to Postgres query optimization, high loaded Sidekiq and PostGIS. Some time later
company started a project for car licence plate recognition and my C++ and building skills became usefull again. I had been
a some kind of release-engeneer for that project: all my —Åolleagues were zealous Mac users without Linux experience. I moved
building system from Xcode to CMake and persuaded everybody to use it. Then I made this [tool](https://github.com/zhulik/bubing)
which helped me to build self-sufficient bundles of linux software and run it on any distribution. Actually I didn't want
to work with low-level stack like C++/OpenCV, so I thoutght about chaning my job again, but I still help them by supporting
server infrastructure and with small web projects.

From the beginning of 2017 and until now I work [here](http://mechanizm.io).
