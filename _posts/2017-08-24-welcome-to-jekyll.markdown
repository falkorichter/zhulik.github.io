So, today I created this blog. I'll try to post in English(my native language is Russian) not for popularity or community,
just because I learn it and this is a good way to improve writing skills. The subjects of this blog: programming,
movies, music, computer games, travels and different tech stuff. Some posts will be extended versions of my
[tweets](https://twitter.com/zhulikgleb): sometimes 140 symbols are not enought to express the idea, so I had to write chains of tweets.
